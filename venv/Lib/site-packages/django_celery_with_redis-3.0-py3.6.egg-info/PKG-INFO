        Contents
        ========
        
        This bundle installs the following packages::
        
            ['django-celery>=3.0,<4.0', 'redis>=2.4.4']
        
        What is this?
        =============
        
        This is a bundle of several packages that you can use as a shortcut in the
        requirements lists of your applications.  Bundles are used to follow a
        common group of packages, or a package with an optional extension feature.
        
        You can install all of the packages in this bundle by,
        
        *using pip*::
        
            $ pip install -U django-celery-with-redis
        
        or *using easy_install*::
        
            $ easy_install -U django-celery-with-redis
        
        Or if you want to add this bundle as a dependency in your application, you
        can add the following identifier in your ``setup.py``'s requires list or
        in your pip requirements files::
        
            django-celery-with-redis
        
        You can also specify a specific version::
        
            django-celery-with-redis>=3.0
